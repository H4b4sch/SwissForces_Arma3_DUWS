_________________________________________________________________________________________________________


A BIG thank you to Kibot for making and releasing his original version. This is my favorite mission to play in Arma 3 with a small group of friends or alone, and without his hard work and skills I probably wouldn't be playing Arma 3 at all yet. I take no credit for this mission, other than my time spent editing in the obvious modifications.

what modifications I've done so far:


- added Armory to FOB's

- added Rest/save to HQ

- added HALO to HQ & FOB's (action menu)

- added Request Units dialogue to FOB's (limited units available only)

- added HEAL to HQ & FOB's (action menu)

- added Repair/Re-arm Vehicles to FOB's (action menu)

- added Teleport/Fast Travel now works with group

- added more options for higher CP mission start (100,200,300,400,600 added)

- added Disable Fatigue option in Parameters screen in mission lobby

- added Time of Day start option in Parameters screen in mission lobby

- added some nite lighting to HQ & FOB's (applied when fortifying)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 23rd, 2014:
- added option to start with higher AP (so enemy will use attack choppers)
- added MLRS to list of vehicles you can request (cost is 100 CP)
- added Titan launchers and their magazines (AA & AT) to the Nato Support Box (supply drop) so AI in your group   can rearm themselves (f#-6).
- adjusted spawn location when requesting units so they'll spawn a bit farther away from the HQ/FOB building     and not get stuck inside.
- fixed the ComboScrollbar errors
- fixed a couple different .rpt errors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 27th, 2014:
- adjusted clean-up script to remove wrecked vehicles and dead bodies every 20 minutes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 28th, 2014:
- fixed support drop (ammo box) from landing too far away (should now land within 30m of where you are     standing when initializing the request)
- fixed an .rpt error related to HALO script
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 29th, 2014:
- fixed settings menu dialogue error in action menu (TAWS terrain view distance)
- addended the word "Modified" to mission name and in arma3 menu's to avoid confusion and so you can have both   versions installed (original and modified) to play without conflict.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 30th, 2014:
- added Scorcher artillary vehicle (100cp) by request (buy at HQ only, not FOB's)
- changed frequency of how often dead vehicles & dead bodies are removed to aid fps performance (every 10   minutes for vehicles/every 15 minutes for bodies)
- requested vehciles spawn slightly further away (+10)from HQ/FOB to avoid possible collision/explosions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 05th, 2014:
- fixed a couple of typos in the mission
- new mission briefing pic to more closely match Kibot's original
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 12th, 2014:
- fixed a bug that caused certain items in your inventory to be duplicated when respawning with REVIVE enabled.
Now, if you play with revive enabled you do not need to use the "load on" button in the armory.
Now, if you play with revive disabled you DO have to use the "load on" button in armory (to respawn with saved loadout). See *note below.

- updated to latest VAS (armory) script (2.4)

- changed HALO ---> All players must now unlock HALO from their request menu to use it (cost 7cp).

- changed Armory ---> All players must now unlock Armory to see it at HQ & FOB action menu's and Supply     Drops (cost 3cp). All players must call in their own supply drops to see Armory in the Nato Box.

- fixed FOB Repair/Rearm Vehicles ---> All players must now unlock Vehicle Refit to see "Repair/Rearm" at FOB   action menu and to use it at HQ with 0-8 menu.

- Time of day as set in the Params menu now syncs properly with JIP players.

*NOTE* - when playing with revive enabled, IF YOU DIE during a HALO attempt you will still be wearing your parachute when you respawn and so it will be necessary to reload your saved kit at an armory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 19th, 2014:

- fixed: teleport/fast travel position has been changed so you & group will not teleport under building anymore...you & group will now teleport just outside front door.

- added small fuel truck(10cp) to request menu vehicles. 

- added slammer tank section squads(55cp) & AA tank platoon squads(70cp)

- added new support usage costs: Halo (7cp to unlock + 3cp per use), Fast Travel/Teleport (2cp per use), Heal (2cp per use), Vehicle Refit at FOB (2cp per use)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 26th, 2014:

- fixed: the "No Fast Travel for Chopper Taxi" Option is now functioning as it should and is set as default.

- fixed: Personal Flir "enable/disable" addaction now works after respawning (under certain conditions you may notice 2 instances of enable appearing in action menu but it will still function properly).

- fixed: When Field Commander Ability unlocks, the Squad Manager Action Menu Item no longer disappears if player respawns.

- tweaked: Default AI skills (should be more difficult to survive now)

- Parameters: Death Penalty defaults at 1cp now, so you lose 1cp each time a human player gets killed.

- New Startup Option for AP Added (225ap is now default...all the other ap options are still there if you wish to choose them at startup).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 28th, 2014:

- tweaked default AI skills again (a little less harsh than previous update, best suited for having your OPTIONS/GAME/DIFFICULTY settings at 0.3)

- tweaked default starting AP down to 200 (alot less attack choppers, sometimes none at all...depends)

- capped starting AP options at 250 for those who want attack choppers gauranteed to come.

- updated to newest HALO script (ATM Airdrop v6 by Pokertour...thank you!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 06th, 2014:

- VEHICLE REFIT: now works at FOB's with the 0-8 menu just as it does at HQ! Thank you Kibot for helping me with that code!! No more having to drive up so close to FOBs anymore...works within 50m, even in choppers!...therefore the "repair" action menu item has been removed since it is not needed.

- NEW Parameter Option (in LAN/Internet mission lobby screen): Enable/Disable Attack Choppers; this is perfect for those who want to start mission with high AP (170-200) but do not want enemy choppers included...also saves fps performance over time! (N/A in Scenario mode).

- Workshop Version ONLY: old way of saving has been re-enabled so you should now be able to use RESUME in SP Scenario using the Steam Workshop version. 

- bug fixed: REVIVE ISSUE - "Always on" Action items missing after respawning with REVIVE ON...this issue is now fixed and you will retain all your action items when playing with revive ON, however a side effect of this fix is that the "revive" action item will pop-up in your action menu whenever you are within close range of (3m) and pointing to someone you've already revived. I can't get rid of it, sorry...but not a bad trade-off really.

- more tweaks to default Opfor skill (best results with your main arma3 menu difficulty slider set to 0.3-0.5 for enemy and 1.0 for friendly)

- new default AP set to 170 (war starts slowly at first but gets intense by 3rd or 4th zone)...BEWARE:use with caution, will cause low fps after awhile...but most high end pc's should maintain 20-35fps. If you dont have a very strong pc then use low AP for start, or consider using the new parameter option to disable attack choppers.

- warcom script adjustments: seems that armored enemy vehicles will actually shoot now :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 10th, 2014:

- Helicopter Taxi & Boat Taxi Fixed: big improvement in chopper/boat behavior when enemy is detected, no more turning away from LZ or endless hovering in the air. Taxi is now operating much more solid, and can be used as reliable transportation, finally!

- HALO on RESUME/LOAD Fixed: When playing a "resumed" or "loaded" session Halo'ing will now give you back your backpack (assuming if you had one in your kit when jumping). Yay!

- HALO chemlights - if you use a chemlight or strobe during your HALO jump you now need to manually remove it after you land, or it will stay lit! (you can remove the light in your action menu). 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 23rd, 2014:

- FOB Creation & Fortification now works for all connected players.

- Artillary/JDAM/Mortar/CBU type supports can now be called by all connected players (players must unlock them first of course).

- Zone Captured & Lost Notifications are now broadcast to all connected players, instead of just the host.

- Blufor team (Players & AI) now earns 0.5cp for each enemy killed on the battlefield.

- HQ Officer can no longer be killed by human players (open servers no longer need to fear a rogue player logging in to kill the officer and ending mission prematurely).

- All players are now group leaders (due to MP issues with AI managment & respawns the ability to join other players groups has been removed, as it should be)

- All players now have markers shown on map, including their vehicle info! (controlled via params menu in mission lobby-enabled by default) script by Aeroson (Thank you!).

- HALO Cost Increased: 10cp to unlock + 5cp per use (to avoid spamming it, and to encourage use of the cost saving and more reaslistic Helo Taxi since it is very reliable now)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 24th, 2014:

- JOIN PLAYER'S GROUP: in Mission lobby, scroll to bottom of role selections to find an open joinable group for up to 5 players. This is included for small player groups who all wish to play in the same group together. It Works best in private servers where players have planned to work in cooperation together without the use of AI.

- More Officer Protection added: player "thrown" or "put" explosives are not allowed within 50m of the HQ building.

- New Request Units Menu addition: Added A-164 Wipeout Airplane (75cp) - *note* spawn this at your own risk for obvious reasons you need to make sure the HQ is located on a flat surface inside an airport so that you'll have access to a runway for taking off...otherwise don't bother buying it!! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*** TO INSTALL ***:
1.Delete any previous pbo files of my MODIFIED version that may be in either your missions or MPmissions folder. It's ok to leave Kibots original version installed with this.

2. Place the new pbo file into either or both the Arma3\missions or Arma3\MPmissions folder.
3. That's it! Go Play it...it shows up in the menus as "Modified".


I'm no coder so most of this is pretty basic cut/paste/modify...nothing fancy but it all works on LAN. Have not FULLY tested with other players connected but as with most non-dedicated MP missions some specific features may only function for the host.

***IMPORTANT TO KNOW (LAN PLAY) - if you're playing on LAN and RESUMING from a SAVE you will need to respawn yourself once (hit esc-respawn) after entering the mission in order to regain any previous support unlocks you had.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***KNOWN ISSUES*** : 

- RESUMING on self hosted server causes previous SUPPORT UNLOCKS to disappear from the 0-8 menu; work-around is to respawn yourself once after a RESUME and all your previous unlocks will reappear (esc-respawn). 

- Resume Arma2 Maps: resume may not work without errors for certain addon maps that contain Arma 2 objects. This mission is only fully compatible with islands that use ONLY Arma 3 objects. You may be able to edit this manually to resume with arma 2 maps but I cannot support it. The mission should run, but you may not be able resume after a save depending upon the island addon you've used. Your mileage will vary.
